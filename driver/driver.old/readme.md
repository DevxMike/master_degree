	Make sure that you installed docker on your system!
		$ docker-compose up -d
		$ Starting driver_driver_1 ... done
		$ docker ps
		$ 8ca53468d1c0   osrf/ros:foxy-desktop   "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   6 minutes ago   Up 18 seconds             driver_driver_1
		$ docker exec -it driver_driver_1 bash
	Now we are inside docker image. If you need to pull ros2 image:
		$ docker pull osrf/ros:foxy-desktop
