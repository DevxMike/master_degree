# Master's Thesis: Navigation Algorithm Study

This repository contains the code and documentation for a master's thesis focused on the investigation of navigation algorithms. The thesis encompasses the following areas:

    Robot Construction:
        Design and construction of the robot platform for experimental purposes.

    ROS2 System Development:
        Development of a Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) based system for controlling the robot.

    Navigation Algorithm Study:
        Exploration and analysis of various navigation algorithms.
        Examination of different odometry algorithms for localization and movement estimation.

# Dependencies

    robot: to run unit tests you will need
        - cmake 3.10 or higher
        - GTest library
	- easyEDA (Recommended)

    arduino software (required libraries):
        - ArduinoJson
        - String (Arduino)
        - PubSubClient    
        - internal arduino libs for use of digital I/O, ext INT or PWM 
	- Platformio (visual studio plugin)

    ROS2 system:
        Make sure that you installed docker on your system!
                $ docker-compose up -d
                $ Starting driver_driver_1 ... done
                $ docker ps
                $ 8ca53468d1c0   osrf/ros:foxy-desktop   "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   6 minutes ago   Up 18 seconds             driver_driver_1
                $ docker exec -it driver_driver_1 bash
        Now we are inside docker image. If you need to pull ros2 image:
                $ docker pull osrf/ros:foxy-desktop
        Or refer to documentation:
                https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/How-To-Guides/Run-2-nodes-in-single-or-separate-docker-containers.html
	
        Or simply type:
                $ sh run_container.sh
